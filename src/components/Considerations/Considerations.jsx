        <h2>Things to Consider</h2>
        <p>
          Part of the stress in creating a ceremony is trying to please everyone and knowing that
          it’s just not possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will help you to eliminate that stress and work on what you would like to happen. With
          that agreed, we can then work on how to involve those you want to be there, but who may
          have reservations about the way you have chosen to celebrate. Remember, these people want
          you to be happy – even though they see things differently from you!
        </p>
        <p>
          There may perhaps, be a disappointed family member, who would have preferred to see you
          get married in a church rather than a register office. I will endeavour to seek a
          compromise, to eliminate any reservations, so that your happiness is not affected.
        </p>

          There may be an older child from a previous relationship who may be confused by all the
          attention being given to a new baby. Perhaps the Naming Ceremony may also be an
          opportunity to include them in a way that cements their place in the second family.
        </p>
        <p>The opportunities are endless!</p>
        <p>Symbolism has a very important place in all the above ceremonies.</p>
        <p>
          A couple may wish to light a candle of unity, ‘jump the broom’, hand-fast, mix sands, and
          more – all to display their bond, as they look to the future, through thick and thin..
        </p>
        <p>
          The lighting of a candle or the pouring of sand at a naming ceremony, similarly, show that
          everyone present wishes to light the way for a child’s future or show the world that the
          child is a permanent part of the family.
        </p>
        <p>
          The symbolic acts are limitless. Between us, we will be able to craft a ceremony with or
          without symbolic acts, that feels like you.
