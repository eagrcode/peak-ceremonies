        <p>This can take place wherever and whenever you like, and in whatever form you wish.</p>
        <p>It might be a small gathering at home, or something more extravagant elsewhere.</p>
        <p>
          You may want it to happen because you wish to celebrate the years. Or possibly, something
          life changing has happened and you want to take the opportunity of expressing your love to
          another, no matter how much time has gone by.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will discuss your plans with you and assist where I can in working out the
          practicalities, as well as preparing a script that reflects you and how far you have come.
          I can voice those emotions that you want to be heard out loud, or help you in the
          preparation of the personal vows you wish to make.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps you want members of your family to be involved. I can liaise to weave them into
          your story, to make it more complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may wish to rededicate your rings, or exchange gifts. All this and more is possible in
          front of an intimate or large number of family and friends, as you decide.
